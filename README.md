### 🗂️ Project Structure

- **The project follows a modular SCSS architecture for scalability and clarity:**
- **Base styles (resets, typography, variables)**
- **Layout styles (grid/sections/global layout rules)**
- **Component styles (buttons, cards, nav, etc.)**
- **Separate JS file for interactions/behaviors**


## Example (high-level) structure:

```bash
.
├─ screenshots/
├─ src/
│  ├─ styles/
│  │  ├─ base/
│  │  ├─ layout/
│  │  └─ components/
│  ├─ scripts/
│  └─ main.js
├─ index.html
├─ package.json
└─ vite.config.* (if applicable)
```

## Folder names may vary slightly depending on your final setup, but the intent remains the same: modular, readable, and easy to scale.
